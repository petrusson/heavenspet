             Hello guys, welcome to my hello world page, my name is Petrus.             I am a web developer who is currently learning HTML. I also have
             knowledge on Python Programming language and R
        </p>
        <p>
            To be a web developer you must know at least one of
            the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Front End Development</li>
            <li>Back End Development</li>
        </ol>
        <p>N/B: It should be noted that someone that knows how to both frontend and Backend is called a FULL STACK DEVELOPER</p>
        <footer>
        <p>
            The following are list of things I am supposed to learn to be a full
             stack developer:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML</strong></li>
            <li><strong>CSS</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Javascript</strong></li>
            <li><strong>SQL</strong></li>
        </ul>
        </footer>
        <p>
                Other programming languages that might be useful as a web developer include:
                <ul>Python   
                <br>R
                <br>Objective C 
                <br>etc.
            </ul>
        </p>
    </body>
